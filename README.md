# Livery-Changer.Edited
This is a new experimental script that has been developed by @Ariakim Taiyo, and I have edited some liveries

Please always run the normal plane before using the added livery

# How to use
Paste index.js into the console. Open it by pressing F12 or CTRL + SHIFT + C
After, close it and run you airplane by the DEFAULT LIVERY, after, you can choose any other livery
